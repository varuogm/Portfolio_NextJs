# Writeup

## I didnt had anything so here comes my L&G writeup that i wrote back in Feb 2023

Hi Team,
Enclosed below is my graduation write-up and summary of my L&G experiences.

It is my last write-up for "Learn and Grow" sessions, and maybe it's my last chance to put my heart out to say something.

This has been a roller coaster ride for me, with some fun breaks in between. I truly enjoyed the sessions, as it was a place where strangers became friends. We tackled everything as a team. It's very unlikely to be seen where people join something to help each other grow selflessly.

It all started when it was announced that we needed to read books, submit write-ups, and attend sessions. I wasn't sure whether it would make any difference to me, but now that it has all passed, I can surely tell that I have insights from a few good books and a punctual habit of doing things. a free way of thinking, considering more about the why part of my actions, etc. There are so many things that cannot be expressed in words but must be experienced. The experience made everyone feel like family.I will not say it has changed my life completely, but now I have more awareness about things and the things I can control. I used to be someone who struggled to initiate things and make new friends, but now I can say that I have made significant progress, and it was all possible because of the setup we had.

One thing that I can share that has helped me is self-introspection. It was a way of identifying my actions and helping me make future decisions. I was always concerned about the consequences of my decisions, whether they were beneficial or detrimental, which frequently resulted in overly complicated solutions. Now even simpler solutions work for me if proper introspection is done. My mum always says life's too short to overcomplicate things, so keep everything simple and bold.And these session taught me how this could be done in a humble way.

I will also feel a void every Tuesday when we finish our sessions, as that is our usual session time. It was our time, and I will miss that. It had become a friends-time now when we all make some time to meet and talk. It was once a compulsion for us, but now I think making it mandatory was beneficial for us rather than optional.I am happy it provided us with a happy place to explore. In our meetings, we covered a broad range of topics that were beneficial for helping us make decisions in practical situations, and I can share one of them. There was a friend of mine, X, with whom I stopped talking some years ago due to some issues that got fixed just because of one of my L&G sessions' introspection and action. Now I believe that if I have the opportunity to fix something, I should do so without waiting for something or any clarification. Life is all about what we want to see. It is now up to me to see what is good or bad. I no longer seek toalways get something in return.

I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me develop self-confidence. Everyone in my team and also our coach, `Tarun`. His practical approach to things helped everyone in our team. Also, our one-on-one counselling helped me during a tough time when I was confused about my decisions. He never forced anything; he let us perceive things according to our nature, which helped me enhance who I am. I am happy to be coached by Tarun.I will also try to become a good orator like him.I would also like to thank my reviewer, Prakash, who corrected all my small mistakes in my writeups.And most most most importantly my Project team Gaia members and mentors especially `Amit`, `Ashish`, `Avani` and `Wamakhshi` who always supported me and helped me absorb good things ,In starting of my career and nurtured me well.I would also like to express my gratitude to my friend `Sanskar`, who has been there for me in every decision and has always had my back.Thank you each one of you who all were mentioned and those who indirectly/directly helped me in multiple ways.

My next plan would be to go forward on the path to excellence with all the learning I have gathered. It has been a process that has changed a part of my life. I'll continue applying these lessons to live a complete and whole life. `Theoretical things might fade away with time, but the experiences I've had in sessions would never`. In the end, I want to thank everyone for the wonderful journey I had.

Thank you for reading.
