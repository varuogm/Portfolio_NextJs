# HNYYYYYYY....

Starting with a quote from Sukuna, I'll begin my rant. Okay.

## Stand Proud you are Strong

This year's beginning was different from any other year. I was with my friends, experiencing the serenity of Uttrakhand in tents while having OM . (All thanks to Shraddha,Vijay,Khushi,Priti,Sanskar)

Anyway, this isn't the actual item I was talking about, so here it is..." clears throat

Ive thought a little and came up with some of the items that ill be making sure to achive (hopefully)

- This year, I'll make an effort to let go of some items from my past.
- I'll gift my family a cute car and also learn driving (GTA instincts kick in).
- I'll make some moves toward financial stability (i havvv some planss 👀)
- Meet my frens irl (TPOT wale bhi)
- I go jim 💪.
- Instead of learning new things, I'll focus on strengthening my existing skills. (A master of everything is a master of none).

All of this would only be possible if I'm with my lovely people, who are all there to support me 🤍.

Absolutely! Wishing you a fantastic New Year filled with joy, success, and wonderful moments ahead. Cheers to new beginnings! 💙
