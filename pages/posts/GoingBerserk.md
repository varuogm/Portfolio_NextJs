## Hey kids Today we will be learning about the `Mark of Sacrifice` (~i want this tatooo on my hand~)ð’‰­

You have now been marked with the `Brand of Sacrifice` (ð’‰­). The lives of those who bear the Brand, from the last drop of blood, to the last moment of your `agonizing death`, will feed life to the new `Child of Darkness`.
â€“ Void, to the branded Band of the Falcon

_in simple terms_ The Brand of Sacrifice has significant impact on the lives of those who receive it, typically resulting in death shortly after it appears.
