# Sam Altman, sacked as board loses confidence in his leadership


We noticed you were not candid with the communications so we have to fire you from your OWN company. ðŸ‘€

`It's too powerful. Sam wanted to nerf it, the board wants the $$$. We all gonna die `

Just after few days after completion of OPENAI devday. It was a shocking news to see SAMA go.


<blockquote className="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people.will have more to say about whatâ€™s next later. </p>&mdash; Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1725631621511184771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>



All of a sudden OpenAI posted an article of transition of their leadership. https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition

## After few hours gdb posted this
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After learning todayâ€™s news, this is the message I sent to the OpenAI team: <a href="https://t.co/NMnG16yFmm">https://t.co/NMnG16yFmm</a> <a href="https://t.co/8x39P0ejOM">pic.twitter.com/8x39P0ejOM</a></p>&mdash; Greg Brockman (@gdb) <a href="https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1725667410387378559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" ></script>


## My thoughts
 In the world, he was an Anon who introduced AGI to ordinary people without expecting any profit, unlike others. He was a pure-hearted individual solely focused on introducing higher levels of technology to its users. In the battle between technology and business, business often wins (recall the arc where Steve Jobs was fired from Apple ditto same to same).



this was how some Anon accounts reacted (got this from Reddit not sure about its authenticity okay)

Im not sure about hes a villain or a superhero but after this incident i do think there would be a ReVeNGe ARC coming soon .like how can a board of directors kicking the main acc of their empire just because he was not listening to its investors and BOD .

chalo koi na lets enjoy tomorrow's IND-AUS finals.


# Edit- This was the very first day items and sama has regained his power. 

## Where is my Ilya Sutskever? The world needs him, and it seems that proper care is not being given to him. Make OpenAI truly open and not solely focused on business
