## WHY i made this :question:

Just to document my day-to-day learnings at some place .also i came across this cute nextraXnextjs template so thought why not to use it

## How ðŸŒš

thinking of adding pages as blogs in my repo and auto depploy will take care of other things. 

## what now and whats next  ::handshake::

try to assemble or bind my other projects here (single point of aceess type of thing) :smile:

also will think about how can i automate pushing a blog to my repo(maybe a ``python`` script to push a file when a readme is detected locally or somewhere on the internet from where it can pull current blogs :thinking: ).


## Timeline  ðŸ¤·

Its hard to maintain consistantancy but i'll try creating a habit of learning and building in public kind of habit going forward :100:
