## WHY i made this :question:

To document my day-to-day learnings in one place, I also came across this adorable nextraXnextjs template, so I thought, 'Why not use it?

## How ðŸŒš

"I'm considering adding pages as blogs in my repository, and automatic deployment will take care of the rest."

## what now and whats next  ::handshake::

"I'm trying to consolidate or integrate my other projects here, creating a single point of access, like a hub. ðŸ˜Š

I'm also considering how I can automate the process of pushing a blog to my repository. Maybe I'll use a Python script to automatically push a file when a readme is detected either locally or from somewhere on the internet where it can fetch the latest blogs. ðŸ¤”"

## Timeline  ðŸ¤·

Its hard to maintain consistantancy but i'll try creating a habit of learning and building in public kind of habit going forward :100:
