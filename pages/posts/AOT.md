### Today after 10 years AOT has come to an end . There are so many things which makes it a top tier anime in the anime history


Eren eyes were closed the whole time during the rumbling 
But he opened them to see mikasa for the last time 🥺 💔

- Eren sacrificed the world for her and Mikasa sacrificed eren to save the world. -

 Mikasa realized that eren couldn't live life with those sins, he wanted to die and sleep peacefully in his afterlife. Mikasa figured out that and killed him. And also eren had to die. Eren's death is the absolute thing in every reality.
  


 Mikasa didn’t just see Eren as a “bloody head” she saw him as the same Eren that she has always known and loved.
