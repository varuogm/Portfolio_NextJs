### Have you watched *Berserk*? I can summarize it in a few points below.

- I've been going through a lot over the past two months, and I've learned some beautiful lessons along the way. After coming across a post by one of my coolest friends on Medium, I couldn't resist sharing my thoughts as well.

Dreams - Achieving goals and dreams requires great sacrifices to the point that it hurts.

Guts - Just as his name implies, have the guts to push through pain, fear, sadness, hopelessness and uncertainties in life.

### Here are some harsh but truthss I've observed, and I think you'll resonate with them too.

- Never rely on fate,who knows anything about fate ,not me atleasyt .I also feel everything happens for a reason but dont wait until something to happen all of a sudden.

- Those you once called friends may fade into the distance as you climb ever higher(but the true ones would always stick by your side,maybe on top of your chats through memes or anything). This harsh reality must be accepted, no matter how it may pain your heart. Press on, for the summit awaits
.([Even Zodd warned guts he tells Guts that he shouldn't consider Griffith a friend because once Griffith achieves his dream, he would betray him ](https://youtu.be/dKNEp3o5edc?si=Drl9dFn1yO47mo9l))

- Dont forget to cut down people from your life if they dont contribute in your life,its my own life,I'll decide who should stay.Its been my nature and im happy being what it is.
