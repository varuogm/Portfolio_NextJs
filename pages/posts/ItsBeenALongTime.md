It's been six long years , and not a single day has passed without me missing you. I've tried to move on, but your absence still lingers in every corner of my life. The void you left behind is a constant reminder of the happiness and connection we once shared.

I've thought about reaching out to you so many times, but fear holds me back. I'm afraid that if I do, it might ruin the fragile   ```equilibrium``` that's been established over the years. I don't want to jeopardize what we have now, even if it's not what it used to be.

I want you to know that I respect your choices and decisions, and I'm grateful for the time we had together. The memories we created are etched in my heart, and I cherish them dearly.

Sometimes, I wonder if you ever think about me, if you ever miss our moments like I do. The    ``uncertainty`` of not knowing adds to the ache that still persists.

I hope you're happy and thriving in your life, and if there ever comes a time when you're open to reconnecting or sharing a conversation, please know that I'm here. Until then, I'll continue to carry the bittersweet memories and the lingering sense of longing in my heart. 

Wishing you all the happiness in the world.
